            Sree Peetam, situated in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, is a prominent spiritual center established by Sri Swami Paripoornananda Saraswati. Dedicated to the promotion of Sanatana Dharma, Sree Peetam has become a hub for devotion, spiritual knowledge, and cultural revival.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the divine leadership of Swamiji, the temple conducts numerous spiritual activities including free **Kumkum Poojas** that empower devotees, especially women, to connect with the divine feminine energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most significant contributions of Sree Peetam is the initiation of the **Maha Sakti Yagam** in 2023 â€” a grand spiritual event performed with intense Vedic rituals to invoke universal peace, harmony, and empowerment through Devi worship. Thousands of devotees participate each year, experiencing deep spiritual transformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            With continuous guidance from Swamiji, Sree Peetam continues to inspire individuals towards dharma, service, and inner awakening.
